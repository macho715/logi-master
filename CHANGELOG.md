## Known Issues

### Critical Issues (Require Immediate Attention)
1. **Large File Scanning**: Performance degradation with >20,000 files
2. **File System Errors**: WinError 2 access issues
3. **Dashboard UI**: Progress display not updating in real-time
4. **Memory Usage**: Potential memory overflow with large datasets

### High Priority Issues
1. **API Key Management**: Session-based storage issues
2. **Cache System**: SQLite locking and concurrency problems
3. **Error Recovery**: Insufficient retry mechanisms

### Medium Priority Issues
1. **Logging**: Limited debugging information
2. **Monitoring**: No real-time performance metrics
3. **Documentation**: Some features lack comprehensive docs
